<h2>🚀 MCP Server for OpenAI LLM Integration with MySQL Database 🚀</h2>

<p><strong>📝 Description:</strong>  
Developed an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables seamless interaction between OpenAI’s Large Language Model (LLM) and a MySQL database. This server acts as a context management layer, allowing the LLM to access and query structured data from the MySQL database in real-time, providing contextually relevant answers to user queries. 🤖💻</p>

<h3>🔑 Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>🔗 Model-Database Integration:</strong> Integrates OpenAI’s LLM with a MySQL database, enabling the model to retrieve real-time data for enhanced, data-driven responses. 💡</li>
  <li><strong>⏱️ Real-time Contextual Query Handling:</strong> Processes user queries, formulates SQL requests, and delivers accurate, context-aware answers based on database information. 🔍</li>
  <li><strong>⚡ Scalability and High Performance:</strong> Designed to handle large-scale interactions, ensuring fast and efficient data retrieval even under heavy query loads. 📈</li>
  <li><strong>🔧 Customizable Context Logic:</strong> Provides customizable query logic to tailor interactions between the model and database for specific use cases, ensuring flexible data retrieval. 🛠️</li>
</ul>

<h3>🛠️ Technologies Used:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>🤖 OpenAI API (Large Language Models)</li>
  <li>💾 MySQL Database</li>
  <li>🐍 Python (for server-side implementation)</li>
  <li>⚙️ Flask/FastAPI (for request handling)</li>
</ul>

<p>This project enhances AI models by enabling them to leverage real-time, structured database knowledge, improving the accuracy and contextual relevance of responses. 🌟</p>
